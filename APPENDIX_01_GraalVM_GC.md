## AOT vs. JIT Compilation in Java

here are two ways of compiling a Java application: using **Just in Time Compilation** (**JIT**) or **Ahead of Time Compilation** (**AOT**). 
The first is the default mode, and it is used by the Java Hotspot Virtual Machine to translate bytecode into machine code at runtime. The latter is supported by the novel GraalVM compiler and allows statically compiling bytecode directly into machine code at build time.
